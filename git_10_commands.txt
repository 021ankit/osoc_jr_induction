1) git remote- To connect a local repository with a remote repository. A remote repositary can have a name set to avoid having to remember the URL of the repository.
2) git pull- To get a latest version of repository run git pull. This pulls the change from the remote repositary to the local computer.
3) git stash- To save changes made when they're no in a state to commit them to a repository. This will store the work and give a clean working directory.
4) git rm- Removes files or directories from the working index. With git rm there are two options to keep in mind: force and cached. Running the command with force deletes the file. The cached command removes the file from working index. When removing an entire directory, a recursive command is necessary.
5) git clean- Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which only operates on tracked files.
6) git revert- Undoes a commited snapshot. When you discover a faulty commit, reverting is a safe and easy way to completely remove it from the code base.
7) git reset- Undoes changes to files in the working directory. Resetting lets you clean up or completely removes changes that have not been pushed to a public repository.
8) git rebase- Rebasing lets you move branches around, which helps you avoid unnecessary merge commits. The resulting linear history is often much easier to understand and explore.
9) git fetch- Fetching downloads a branch from another repositary, along with all of its associated commits and files. But it does'nt try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect chnges before merging them with your project.
10) git reflog- Git keeps track of updates to the tip of branches using a mechanism called reflog. This allows you to go back to changes even though they are not referenced by any branch or tag.

This is another line to create merge conflict

This line is added because we want to crreate merge conflict
